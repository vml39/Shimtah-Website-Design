# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.
Yellow Eagle
Vivian Li - vml39
Subin Kwon - sk2322
Sameena Asija - sa655
Hye Jin Kwon - hk884

2. To what goals do we all commit?
To fulfilling our client's needs in a beautiful and functional website.

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
All members are to finish delegated tasks before our weekly meetings, 5:00 pm on Thursdays. Our tasks should be completed by Tuesday 2:00pm, giving us enough time to make final edits and changes if necessary. Members will be expected to reply to group messages within 24 hours. However, if unforeseeable and unavoidable circumstances arise suddenly before the meeting, then the meeting will be moved to another time at the group's convenience.

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
All members will communicate via Groupme. Weekly meetings will be held at 5:00 pm on Thursdays at Temple of Zeus unless there is prior notice that a member cannot attend. Meetings are subject to change, and more than one meeting per week may be necessary depending on the demands on the group for each milestone.

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?
One of our members will serve as our client liaison and will meet with our client as often as necessary throughout the course of the project.

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
Meeting leader: Sets an agenda for the team meeting and keeps the team on track during the meeting. Rotates each week.
Scribe: Records meeting notes and scheduling conflicts. Rotates each week.
Client liaison: Primary source of communication with the client. The role belongs to one person throughout the entirety of the project.
Submission Manager: Checks to make sure all necessary materials are submitted to Github before the milestone deadline. Rotates each week.

7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
If a member is late to a meeting by over 15 minutes OR if a member hasn’t completed their work for the meeting without a valid excuse, then the member is responsible for bringing snacks for all members at the next meeting. If this occurs more than two times, then further action will be taken as seen fit.

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
A vote will be taken among the team members, and the majority vote will win (within reason). If conflict continues, then the team members will meet at a determined TA’s office hours and will ask the TA for their opinion on the matter.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
If the contract needs to be revised at any time, the meeting leader will set aside a few minutes during the meeting to discuss revisions.

In the case of death, injury, or extreme illness of a team member, then the team will proceed as usual, delegating the team member’s tasks to the others.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
The team will celebrate with food upon completion of the project.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
